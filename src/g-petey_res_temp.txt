fren, please can you compile a report on the  state of the art in hybrid software-hardware computing as used to boost processing power of ai computing systems, specifically focusing on use of analog or hybrid analog-digital setups, including those employing fuzzy logic, to boost vector type math and parallel processing capabilities.
use bullet points, charts and tables where necessary to clearly display information and try to be clear about the actual state of development of different technologies w.r.t. time before a feasibly mass-produced, cheap and user-friendly version is available on the market, most likely.
ChatGPT said:
Got it! To make this report as useful as possible, could you clarify a few things:

Scope of Technologies: Should I focus only on AI computing accelerators (e.g., neuromorphic chips, analog computing for AI workloads) or also general-purpose hybrid computing (e.g., FPGA-based analog-digital acceleration)?
Market Readiness Emphasis: Are you mainly interested in technologies close to commercialization, or should I also include experimental/lab-stage research?
Application Areas: Do you want a focus on specific AI tasks (e.g., deep learning, large-scale simulations, reinforcement learning) or a broad overview?
Depth of Coverage: Would you like an in-depth technical breakdown (circuit designs, architecture-level descriptions), or a higher-level industry overview of trends and key players?
Let me know, and I’ll get started on this report!

You said:
1. i'm specifically interested in analog electronic computing tech such as bipolar vca based nand gate neural nets and the like - neuromorphic chips do hold interest for me but i don't need to know about fpga-based acceleration.
2. i'm interested in both tech close to commercialization and exp./lab-stage but with a leaning towards those closer to commerce ready.
3. a broad overview please.
4. just a higher-level industry overview of trends and key players but with a little detail for each key player, just enough specifics to give me some idea exactly what they might be investigating compared to any other or myself - i.e. no need for circuit designs or architecture level descripts, just some brief overview infos.
